## What is it?

It's a game played on a phone where the goal is to find the number of marbles by moving your phone in all directions. You can feel the jolts when the marbles touch an edge of the screen or when the marbles touch each other.

This is an idea coming from a [switch game](https://www.nintendo.fr/Jeux/Nintendo-Switch/1-2-Switch-1173186.html).
